# SignalR-PlainJS-Example #

This is an example of a SignalR backend with a javascript client. It uses the Microsoft provided javascript library.

I've put it up here because the SignalR examples I found online were all broken.

## What it does ##

The SignalR LogHub broadcasts a randomly generated log message periodically.

## Dependencies ##

- Visual Studio 2015

## Setup ##
    
1. Open the AmazingServicesWeb solution.
2. Build the Solution, then launch it with "Start Debugging".

Your browser should launch, start the client, and connect to the SignalR hub.
